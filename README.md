## Testing

If you want to try WindowManager's current status, you can test it using Xephyr:

```bash
# Start Xephyr on display :1
Xephyr -ac -br -screen 1300x900 -reset :1 &

# Set the DISPLAY environment variable
export DISPLAY=:1

# Run the window manager
uroswm
# Or run in background to free the command line
uroswm &
```

**Note:** The display number `:1` is what you set for Xephyr. It cannot run on the same display where X11 is already running.

Distributions may set the `DISPLAY` environment variable differently based on their needs. For example:
- On **Ubuntu**, you typically cannot use `DISPLAY=:1` because it's already used by X11. You would need to use `DISPLAY=:2` for Xephyr instead.
- On other distributions you can usually use `:1`.
